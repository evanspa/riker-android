    <!-- General Info Activity -->
    <string name="general_info_how_riker_dists_values" formatted="false"><![CDATA[<p>Every movement in Riker hits a set of muscles.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are <strong>primary muscles</strong> hit and <strong>secondary muscles</strong> hit.</p><p>For example, the primary muscles hit with <Strong>bench press</strong> are: the upper and lower chest muscles.&nbsp;&nbsp;The secondary muscles hit are: the three heads of the tricep muscle group.</p><p>Riker distributes <strong>80%</strong> of the total weight lifted and reps of a set to the primary muscles hit, and distributes the remaining <strong>20%</strong> to the secondary muscles hit.</p><p>If there are multiple primary muscles and multiple secondary muscles hit, the assigned weight and reps are distributed across them evenly.</p><p>So if you do a set of <strong>10 reps of 135 lbs</strong> on bench press, the total weight lifted is: <strong>1,350 lbs</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;80% of that weight (<strong>1,080 lbs</strong>) and 80% of the reps (<strong>8 reps</strong>) are assigned to the primary muscles; the upper and lower chest.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since there are 2 primary muscles hit, they are each assigned <strong>540 lbs and 4 reps</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The secondary muscles hit are assigned 20% of the total weight lifted and reps (<strong>270 lbs and 2 reps</strong>).&nbsp;&nbsp;Since there are 3 secondary muscles hit (medial, lateral and long heads of the tricep), they are each assigned <strong>90 lbs and 0.67 reps</strong>.]]></string>
